## Major Components

### OpenCV (C++)
- Encode a landing pad using base 4
- Identify and cut landing pad from photo (account for rotation)
- Normalize the image to account for glare or other factors
- Decode the landing pad

### MAVProxy (Python)
- Initial flight pattern
- Search for the landing pad
- Land if successfully decoded and verified
